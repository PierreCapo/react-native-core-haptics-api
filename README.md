# react-native-core-haptics-api

ðŸ“³  react native &lt;> iOS Core Haptics

## About

react-native-core-haptics is a lightweight iOS-only module designed to expose the following Core Haptics methods to React Native:

- `-capabilitiesForHardware`
- `-stop`
- `-makePlayer`
- `-start`

This requires surfacing the following classes:

- `HapticDeviceCapabilty`
- `HapticEventParameterID`
- `HapticEventParameter`
- `HapticEventEventType`
- `HapticEvent`
- `HapticPattern`
- `HapticPatternPlayer`
- `HapticEngine`

These features are made available using syntax and patterns that resemble the native Swift implementation as closely as possible.

No other functionality is planned for this library, although feature parity with iOS Core Haptics is technically possible.

## Install

```sh
yarn install SnowcodeDesign/react-native-core-haptics-api
```

or

```sh
npm install SnowcodeDesign/react-native-core-haptics-api
```

## Usage

```js
// import the needed classes at the top of the file
import { HapticEngine, HapticEventParameterID, HapticEventParameter, HapticEventEventType, HapticEvent, HapticEvent, HapticPattern } from 'SnowcodeDesign/react-native-core-haptics-api';

// when setting up your component...
const engine = await HapticEngine.create();

// later down, in the implementation...
const startTime = 0;
const events = [{
    eventParameters: [{
        id: "HapticIntensity",
        value: 1,
    }, {
        id: "HapticSharpness",
        value: 0.6
    }],
    eventType: "HapticContinuous",
    duration: 0.5,
    relativeTime: 0
}];

// then, when you're ready to play...
if (!engine.capabilitiesForHardware().supportsHaptics) {
    return;
}

const shouldStop = false;
if (shouldStop) {
    await engine.stop();
    return;
}

// to chain together patterns and haptic events...
let patterns = [];
for (let event in events) {
    const parameters = event.eventParameters.map(parameter => {
        const parameterID = new HapticEventParameterID(parameter.id);
        const value = parameter.value;
        const eventParameter = new HapticEventParameter(
            parameterID, 
            value
        );
        return eventParameter;
    });

    const eventType = HapticEventEventType(event.eventType);
    const relativeTime = event.relativeTime;
    const duration = event.duration;

    const hapticEvent = new HapticEvent(
        eventType, 
        parameters, 
        relativeTime, 
        duration
    );

    const hapticEvents = [hapticEvent];

     try {
        const pattern = new HapticPattern(
            hapticEvents
        );
    } catch (e) {
        continue;
    }

    if (!pattern) {
        continue;
    }

    patterns.push(pattern);
}

// now, time to play all the constructed patterns...
for (let pattern of patterns) {
    const player = await engine.makePlayer(decodedPattern);

    await engine.start();
    await player.start(startTime);
}
